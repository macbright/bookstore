# Calculator with React 

This project comes after the introduction of the React & Redux JS framework. The main aim of the project is to learn how to build a very simple React application using Redux as a state management system. The project has been split into multiple milestones, and each milestone has functional and technical requirements that needs to be implemented.

The project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ "The Global School for Remote Software Developers!").
